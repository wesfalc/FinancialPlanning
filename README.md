From a LinkedIn post I made in 2021.

I spent the last few days working on a new financial calculator for my own purposes. There are a few financial calculators available online that allow you to do basic things. But I wanted one where you can add life events, such as marriage, or buying a house and have the expenses for those events reflect in the calculation. Unfortunately, I didn't find any websites that did that. So I decided to build one myself!

Of course, use this at your own risk! Do not consider it to be any sort of advice. Do your own research! Consult a professional before investing! You get the idea.

Here in this image is a very simple calculation for a young professional starting from $0 in investments. Let's say his name is Bob. Let's assume that Bob has no outstanding debts, he has an emergency fund in place, and is now looking to invest his money in the stock market. Let's assume his annual rate of return is 10%. 

Besides contributing to his 401k, Bob is able to invest in a separate brokerage account. Let's say his initial monthly contribution is $2000 a month. 

Year 1 - $2000 contributed every month. 

Bob has a girlfriend. He and his girlfriend are serious about their relationship and Bob thinks they will likely get married 2 years from now. So let's add that to the calculation. 

Year 3 - $750 contributed per month, since Bob is saving for marriage.

Year 4 - $10,000 a one time expense as Bob and his wife figure things out after marriage. 

Year 4 - $1000 monthly contribution since Bob isn't saving for marriage any more, but he reckons he will have higher expenses than before. 

Year 5 - They may have their 1st kid. One time withdrawal of say $6000.

Year 5 - Monthly contribution reduced to $600 a month. 

Year 6 - Bob's wife is working again, so now their contribution increases to $3000 a month. 

Year 9 - Bob thinks by this time their salaries should have significantly increased to allow them to contribute $4000 a month.

Year 10 - Bob thinks they might have a second kid at this time, so their monthly contribution will reduce to $3200. 

At this point they have figured out marriage and kids, so they continue to be stable in their investments. 

Year 12 - Bob thinks their salaries will increase by this time to allow them to contribute $4000 a month again. 

Years 13 - 19 - No change. They live a stable life and continue contributing. 

Year 20 - By this time Bob and his wife are millionaires and 50 years old. They have 10 more years before their 401k kicks in, but they think they have saved sufficiently to retire. 

So, 

Year 20 - Bob buys a house for $325k, a one time withdrawal, and he and his wife retire with a monthly withdrawal of $3000, which Bob thinks should be sufficient for them at that time.
